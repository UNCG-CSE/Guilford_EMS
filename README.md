# Guilford_EMS
# Introduction
  In this project, we are working with the Guilford County Emergency Medical Services, EMS, data sets which includes call records from the flowing agency:
  - GCSD Guilford County Sheriff Department 
  - GCF Guilford County Fire Department
  - EMS	 Emergency Medical Service
  - ACO Animal Control
  
Upopn completion of the project, we should be able to 
  - Relationships between trending natures for calls and each agency; patterns between geographic area and leading calls’ natures; identification of predictors of emergency call categorization as “sick person”-later on if time permits.
  - Correlate time of the call with the nature of the call, and understand the patterns in which the calls happen in terms of time as hours, days, and months.
  - Response reaction time based on nature.
  - Nature and matching priority(priority always based on operator, is it over time changed).
