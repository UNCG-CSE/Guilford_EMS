# The Data Set
  In this project, we are working with the Guilford County Emergency Medical Services, EMS, data sets which includes call records from the flowing agency:
  - GCSD Guilford County Sheriff Department 
  - GCF Guilford County Fire Department
  - EMS	 Emergency Medical Service
  - ACO Animal Control
  
Mainly what the purpose of my portion of the project was to find out all I could find on the Priorities.
ONe of the things we wanted to test was if the priorities changed over time and if we could accurately predict priorities.
