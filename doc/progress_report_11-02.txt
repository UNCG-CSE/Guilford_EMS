Question asked
  - Will the response time become slower if a particular call nature receive significantly more calls?
  - will the response time also become slower during any particular day, time, or weeks, or months?
    (note: this question has not been fully examined)
Why was the question asked?
  - I would like to examine the relationship between the volume of calls and average response time. 
Describe the method
  - Remove the outliner, create new data frames with call volumes and average response time
  - Graph the results
What was done to solve for the question?
  - graph the data columns
  - Finding the correlation between the call volume and respone time 
Describe outcomes.
  - The call response time remain realatively unchanged despite the call volumes have increased. 
What were the outcomes
  - No significant correlation between the 2 data columns
What are their implications
  - High call volume does not shorten the response time of the agences.
  - This could be due to most called got routed to the agences were within a radius distance, calls outside of the radio were routed to agences from different district.
