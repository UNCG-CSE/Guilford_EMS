In this project, we are working with the Guilford County's Public Safety data sets which includes call records from the following agency: Animal Control,  Emergency Medical Service, 
Guilford County Sheriff Department, Guilford County Fire Department.

We want to analyze if the allocation of the resources thowards the different tasks is equitable and eventually make suggestions about how they can allocate resources in a better way.

In order to achieve that, here are some of the tasks that each member has to investigate:

    Relationships between reasons for calls and each agency; patterns between geographic area and top reasons for calls/natures with the highest priority call volume; for some of the natures, apply machine learning to predict them; based on the location of the calls, use machine learning to make suggestions for future desired locations for hospitals, animal center, etc; identification of predictors of emergency call categorization as “sick person”-later on if time permits
    Correlate time of the call with the nature of the call, and understand the patterns in which the calls happen in terms of time as hours, days, and months.
    Response reaction time based on nature.
    Nature and matching priority(priority always based on operator, is it over time changed).
