Project Introduction

In this project, we are working with Guilford County Emergency Medical Services, EMS Data set. This Data set inludes call records from the following agencies since 2012 and still get updated once a week:

- GCSD Guilford County Sheriff Department 
- GCF Guilford County Fire Department
- EMS Emergency Medical Service
- ACO Animal Control

We are taking out the ACO because it isn’t very accurate, because the people bring animals that  aren't always from Guilford county.
This data set include things Nature of the call, time. Service, agency, district, seconds until arrival, Seconds until dispatch and more seconds 

The goals of the project are related to the major feature of the data, calls:       
- Trending natures for calls and reasons for trending?                                        
- Are the emergency resources used efficiently or poorly?                              
- Suggestion for improving the resources usage?

To get answers to the questions, here are the established goals:
- To find relationships between different natures of the calls and agencies.
- To find high call volumes and correlate that to events, areas, or agencies.
- To find relations between high call volumes and socio-economic factors

Tasks

Data cleaning and manipulation
On the new dataset that has geo locations:
- Filter out where cancelled calls field = True, report only field = True, nature = Transport to Animal Shelter, 
- Remove unnecessary fields related to location as: statbeat, ra
- Associate codes for text fields
- Manipulate calltime field: split into 2 fields: year, time

Topics/ Hypothesis/ Assigned Tasks
 - Relationships between trending natures for calls and each agency; patterns between geographic area and leading calls’ natures; identification of predictors of emergency call categorization as “sick person”-later on if time permits.(Oana)
- Correlate time of the call with the nature of the call(Jason said this was a big interest for them)(Saed)
 - Response reaction time based on nature(Jason said this was a big interest for them)(Linh)
 - Nature and matching priority(priority always based on operator, is it over time changed)(Daniel)

Later - need more Data for these topics
Geo location  and natures( multiple people will probably work on this)
Social economics and calls/ nature(not sure we want to do this topic)
