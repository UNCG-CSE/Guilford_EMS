1. Predicting time needed for situation resolution since the moment of arrival to the moment of transport.
Used different machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression.
2. Predict natures - 4 most popular natures, using Logistic Regression, K neighrest neighbors, Random Forest Classifier.
Highest performance for Random Forest Classifier with accuracy of 0.7.
3. Predicting locations for new hospitals, animal shelters, fire stations, police stations using KMeans with 1 cluster.
Find the center of that cluster.

Final Progress Report

For the final project I tried to create a Machine Learning Classifier that will guess the priority of the nature of the call based on some of the features in the data set. The data is categorical so a classifier should work better than a regression model.

I ran into error with missing values so drop all the values with any nan values to get rid of the complication because there is alot of data and I didnt want to try to summarize any of the columns.

For this I use the K Neighbors, decision Tree and Random Forest Algorithms because these are common ones. I also tried SVC but it took to long and after two days it didnt finish, and that was with only 1000  samples with 100 samples the accuracy was too low.

1. Some Data Visualization using the notebooks of "Data Visualization".
2. Supervised Machine Learning to Predict "Agency" related to a certain call using Call Time, Location of Call, and Call source.
  * RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifer where used to train the data.
  * To improve the performance, created a label-balanced dataset.
  * Got 77% accuracy, 77% precision, 77% recall, and 0.93 AU-ROC.
  * This model can be used to alert a certain agency of a potential duty, in order to prepare themselves.
